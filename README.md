# download-reuters
Periodically downloads the [https://www.reuters.com/] site using the fantastic [newspaper3k library](https://newspaper.readthedocs.io/en/latest/).
Output files are time-stamped and contain 128 cases (i.e. you can read them with an editor without stressing
memory). Program can be easily modified to handle other sites.
